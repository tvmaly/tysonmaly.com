Strong coffee is more than just the amount of caffeine in the cup.  How to make strong coffee is my step by step guide on how to make a full flavored cup of coffee that has all the nuances and flavors in the bean brought out in the cup of coffee.  Most people have never heard of the method I describe below.

&nbsp;

My method uses full immersion coffee brewing method that gives your coffee a very deep flavor.  This method is not for everyone.  It is more for those people that really love coffee and its flavor in the same way that a wine connoisseur likes all the flavors in a good bottle of French Bordeaux. ( spoiler alert: <a href="http://amzn.to/1VC0gnF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this</a> dripper is the secret that makes this method work so well)

Step one requires you to find a good whole coffee bean that appeals to your tastes.  I prefer darker beans with an oily appearance.  I prefer buying freshly roasted beans from a local roaster.  Freshly roasted beans still have the gasses in the bean, so the flavor profile of the coffee is much different compared to a bean that has been sitting for weeks.  You usually only have about 7 days before all the gasses leak out of the roasted beans.

Step two requires you to grind the beans.  I own an electric grinder, but I do not use it to grind my coffee beans.  I only use it to grind whole peppercorns when I am making a steak rub or encrusted prime rib.  I use a ceramic hand coffee bean grinder because it grinds the beans in a consistent manner that I can control.  Electric coffee bean grinds shatter the coffee beans into pieces that are not uniform.  This creates an uneven taste, and it ruins your strong coffee.

I generally fill my ceramic coffee bean grinder to almost the top with beans.

Step three requires boiling water.  I usually measure two cups or 16 ounces of filtered wated out to boil.  You can boil the water on a stovetop or in the microwave for 5 minutes.

Step four, you are going to brew the coffee in a full immersion system.  I use the inexpensive [Clever dripper](http://www.tysonmaly.com/reviews/full-immersion-coffee/) but feel free to splurge on a more expensive porcelain one.  Place a number 4 cone coffee filter in the Clever dripper and wet it with some of the boiling water.

Step five, place the ground coffee grains inside the filter and slowly add the water.  Place the top on the Clever dripper and set a timer for 1 minute and 30 seconds.

Step six, when the timer finishes, using a knife or fork, gently stir the grains on the top till they are more disolved into the liquid.

Step seven, put the top back on the Clever dripper and set the timer for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Prepare your coffee cup. I like to add cinnamon into my cup for the various health benefits, but this is optional.

Step eight, when the timer is finished, place the Clever dripper on top of your coffee cup.  The liquid will drain into your cup.  Be sure to monitor this so it does not overflow out of the cup.

Step nine, dispose of the contents of the filter and used coffee grains.  Some people use them for compost for gardens. Wash your Clever dripper quickly with water to clear away loose grains.

Step ten, enjoy you strong cup of coffee.

This method of how to make strong coffee was developed by myself through trial and error.  It is by far my favorite way to make a strong cup of coffee.   I have made it part of my morning ritual.

You can also make strong cold brew coffee with a slightly different method if you prefer cold coffee.

Strong coffee is great for parents that have just had a newborn baby.  It is also great for college students or programmers that need to get some work done on their projects.

One last thing, If you want to try this method out read my short write up on <a href="http://www.tysonmaly.com/reviews/full-immersion-coffee/" target="_blank">full immersion coffee drippers</a> to help you get started as not all drippers are good for beginners.
