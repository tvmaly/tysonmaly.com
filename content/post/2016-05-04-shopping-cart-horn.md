# How to solve shopping cart rage when the aisles are too crowded with carts

This fantastic little horn has been my goto solution for solving the problem of crowded aisles in the grocery store.

Here is what I love about this horn:

  * You can&#8217;t beat the <a href="http://amzn.to/1UzZ3Mc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">price</a>
  * It can be used when your out walking or biking to make sure cars can see you or to scare runners
  * It is a great story piece, people are always asking me about it
  * It is small, I mean small, it fits in my hand
  * It runs on a 9 volt battery so you won&#8217;t need compressed air
  * It is water proof
  * You can tap it lightly and get a smaller sound for indoor use

Its always fun to have a good story, and this horn has given quite a few over the last few years.
