Here is the simple method you can use to clean eye glasses.  This method is safe and will not harm glasses with anti-reflective coatings.  I have been using this method for years, and I told my co-worker about it.  I did not give it much thought, but she said it works really well for her.  So I decided to share it with everyone.  I use to buy these lens cleaner wipes from the local pharmacy, but I found this method works much better.  I do still carry special <a href="http://amzn.to/1QZX6Sw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lens cleaners</a> in the car or when traveling as I do not always have access to this method.  You can get a pack of 200 of them, but make sure they are alcohol free as this is what damages coatings on the lenses.

  1. Use a dish soap that is not very sticky, I would recommend the <a href="http://amzn.to/1XmPuBl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seventh Generation dish soap</a> as it washes off easily, and it comes in a non scented version so your glasses do not smell like soap.  One bottle is enough to last you years if cleaning glasses is all you use it for.  If you use a very sticky soap, like the kind used to deep soak pots in, it will be harder to wash off.  Do not use hand soaps as they tend to have conditioners and hydration additives that can leave residue on you glasses.
  2. place 1 small dot of soap on both sides of each lens.  Do not use more soap than this or you will end up having issues at the drying stage.  It will leave soap streaks from excess soap that did not wash off.
  3. Before you touch the soap, turn on the water on the sink.
  4. Place one lens at a time under the flowing water and immediately start rubbing your index finger and thumb against the lens to spread around the soap.  Keep doing this swirling motion for 10 to 15 seconds.  This should be enough time to clear all the soap.  Repeat this same process for the other lens.
  5. Shut off the water and shake you wet hand or hands.  Optionally if you can, dry the excess water off your hands with a paper towel or cloth.  This is important because if you do not, you will get excess water drops on the lenses and it will leave water marks.
  6. With a paper towel, dry each lens using your index finger and thumb in a circular motion.  Move to a dry piece of the same paper towel if the existing spot gets too damp.  Repeat this process for the other lens.

That is the method, and it gets all sort of streaks and smudges out of your glasses.   I use this method when I wake up in the morning, and right before I get in front of a computer screen.

I wrote another post on issues with [cleaning macbook screens](/diy/computers/how-to-clean-macbook-pro-screen/) if you happen to own one.

Here is a short video that demonstrates why you do not want to use eye glass cleaners that are sold in stores
