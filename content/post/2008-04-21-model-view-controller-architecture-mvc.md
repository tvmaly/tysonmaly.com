The Model View Controller (MVC) pattern is very popular in the web applications world. Many web programmers might have a story about a web project that grew out of hand with messy asp or php pages. The html and scripting language can grow so close that you would need a designer and program handcuffed together to make a minor change to the system. This can present a major problem both for resources and for future maintenance.Seperating Business Logic from the presentation in web applications

The Model View Controller (MVC) pattern is very popular in the web applications world. Many web programmers might have a story about a web project that grew out of hand with messy asp or php pages. The html and scripting language can grow so close that you would need a designer and program handcuffed together to make a minor change to the system. This can present a major problem both for resources and for future maintenance.

MVC allows one to seperate the business logic (Model) of a web application from the look and feel also called the view. The controller handles the go betweens of the business logic and the views. Generally there are additional components in the framework called actions. These actions may handle things like validating that the correct amount of information was entered. Or they may perform some logic and pass controll back to the controller.

It may take a PHP programmer a little while to get up to speed with MVC if they are new to object oriented programming. But once they are up and running, it can save them a ton of time developing larger web applications. It will allow you to focus on the bigger picture. Once you have a framework in place, you can become more productive at producing web applications in a shorter amount of time.

Take a look at the phrame project below. I have used it in as the basis for my web applications. It comes with a simple user login demo. PHP architect magazine also has a free version that happens to include an extensive article on MVC with a system based on phrame.
