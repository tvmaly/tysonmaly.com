## Here is how you can clean a macbook pro screen

There was a little bit of confusion for people trying to figure out how to clean a retina screen.  I recently visited an apple store and the apple employee told me not to use any alcohol based cleaners or any glass cleaners like windex.  I asked if they had any cleaners in the store, and he showed me one they carried.   I checked the bottle and it listed alcohol as a content.   I did not want to void the warranty on my new 15 inch macbook pro, so I had to search for a better solution.

Before I go any further, I must warn you that your macbook&#8217;s screen coating could come off.  If it does, there is nothing you can do to fix your screen.  First check your screen for any strange looking issues on the surface of your screen.  There is an ongoing issue with the anti-reflective coating on certain screens.  If your coating is wearing off your screen, you should not attempt to clean the screen.  See <a href="http://www.staingate.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Staingate</a> for details on the issue and what Apple is doing to resolve it.

Here are the steps to follow to clean your macbook pro retina screen.

  1. Shut down your macbook pro laptop
  2. Using a super soft micro cloth, lightly dampen the cloth with water.
  3. Wring the cloth to remove any excess water to prevent drenching the screen.
  4. Lightly wipe off any smudges, dirt, or hand oil streaks on the screen.
  5. Allow your screen to dry before powering your macbook back up.

Please note that certain people have more acidic content in their skin oils, so this could cause some eventual issues with screens.
