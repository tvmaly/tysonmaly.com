  My name is Tyson Maly. I am a computer engineer working in the financial services industry for the past 11 years.  I am involved in our companies Devops committee, and I have a passion for automating things.  I have also moonlighted as a consultant building web applications for businesses.   This site has been around since 2003.  I have been programming Perl since 1996, and I have been developing websites since 1995.  I have a wide variety of skills and can program the full stack from the devops side to the front-end user interface.

  I recently had to upgrade a task management system that has been running since 2006.   It was based off the dotproject project management system written in PHP.  Due to a move to a newer version of PHP, the system had some issues.   Upon patching the system, I realized that the latest version of PHP had quite a handful of new features.

  I have worked with PHP quite a bit over the years.  I wrote my own CMS system that supported both MySql and Postgresql back in 2004.  This system supported clients I was consulting for at the time.

  WordPress has grown quite a bit since I began using it when it was just a simple blog system.  I am working on a few plugins for the system.  If you have a business that is in need of a feature for your wordpress site, feel free to contact me.  I can discuss what is possible given your requirements.

  Over the last several years,  I have started a few mobile web apps using the Go programming language.  I am finding that Go aka golang supplements some of the dynamic languages quite well.   I recently had a task to scan a large number of Excel documents for a discovery request.  I bench marked scanning the documents in Go verse Perl and I found I could achieve between 5x and 10x speedup using Go.

  I have developed a number of micro services  for my current side project <a href="https://bestfoodnearme.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Food Near Me &#8211; Food Dishes by location </a>

  Deployment and development of micro services in Go is more straight forward as you are dealing with single binaries as opposed to other languages that have heavy dependencies.
